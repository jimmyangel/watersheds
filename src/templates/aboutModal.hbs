  <h4>About this site</h4>
  <p>This site is an interactive map for visualizing Oregon's <u>surface</u> drinking water sources (i.e., water from rivers, streams and lakes), which serve about two-thirds of Oregonians.</p>
  <p>Pick a spot on the map to discover interconnected populations and communities by way of common drinking watersheds. Use the provided basemaps and overlays to customize the view.</p>
  <p>Groundwater sources (i.e., water sourced from deep wells and aquifers) are <u>not</u> included in this map.</p>

  <small><b>Notes about data quality:</b>
    <br><br>
    <p>Mapping populations to drinking watersheds in Oregon can be complex given that some communities have multiple water sources or change their source based on the season. We tried to stay true to the goal of answering the question of "who's drinking water is influenced by any given spot on the map." This was particularly complex to do while avoiding double counting populations. No populations are double counted on this map.</p><p>This layer heavily relies on the original mapping by DEQ, however there are several instances where they didn't map the full extent of a community watershed and we have modified it to do so.</p><p>If you see any inaccuracies, please contact <a href="mailto:ef@oregonwild.org" target="_blank">Erik at Oregon Wild</a> </p>
